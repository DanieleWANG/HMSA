Data availability:
> The CSI300 and CSI800 datasets can be obtained from the following repository: [https://github.com/SJTU-DMTai/MASTER](https://github.com/SJTU-DMTai/MASTER). Please download the data located under the `opensource` directory.
> For the S&P 500 dataset, refer to [https://github.com/kijeong22/ijcai2025-spf](https://github.com/kijeong22/ijcai2025-spf). You only need to download the files `baseline_sp500.npy` and `sp500_index.csv`, and compute the Alpha158 features and market-related indicators following the same preprocessing pipeline as MASTER. For details, refer to `data/csi_market_information.csv` in the MASTER repository.
> Note that the SPF authors provide several preprocessed hypergraph datasets, which are not required for replication and can be safely ignored.
